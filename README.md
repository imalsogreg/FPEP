## Functional Programming Elevator Pitch ##

I wrote this because I found myself repeatedly trying to explain to my neuroscience friends why I'm using Haskell instead of Matlab.  I found that those talks went a lot better when I had ghci handy and could show them example code.  When trying to explain *without* ghci, I had a lot less luck.  So I thought it would be nice to have the Elevator Pitch with some working code examples, that Haskellers could use as a reference for curious inquirers, potential new hires, etc.

The target audience is someone who hasn't really thought about FP, but might take interest if shown a couple fun examples.  The goal is to get more people into FP and Haskell, for their own benefit (I was really glad when someone told *me* about it!), and so that we might have more enthusiasns who could grow up into maintainers.

### The immediate goals of this post are: ###

* Quickly demo FP concepts through Haskell
* Don't necessarily teach - that's what the other SoH posts are for
* Dispell common myths (eg: Haskell is impossible to learn; pure code can only work on static data sets - could never model a timeseries, etc)
* Make a consistent 'Haskell is good' case without misrepresenting difficulties
* Get examples that can be toyed with (must be simple enough that they don't require any Haskell knowledge, but complex enough to demo a concretely useful language feature - this is tricky given the non-teaching goal!)
* Encourage people to download/try, read a few chapters in LYAH and go through a couple SoH tutorials 
* Foot in the door for all those wonderful teaching blogs and conference talks on Youtube.

### I'm pretty new to Haskell, so I would love to see any of the following: ###

* A post that does a better job than this one, which I can use as a reference for people asking me about Haskell.
* Improvements that make this document more concise, convincing
* Better example cases
* Improvements that make it more accurate
* Suggestions about adding other sections (laziness?  modules?)
* ... or removing some
* Another SoH post with the same intention as this one, started from scratch by someone a little more knowledgeable than me
* Any other comments/suggestions/advice

Any contributions along those lines are greatly appreciated!  Feel free to use the issue tracker and/or and make pull requests against this repository, and I'll merge those changes to the School of Haskell version.

Thanks!
